# Security Analysis Report

This document contains a draft of the security vulnerabilities found in the codebase.

### Finding 1: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

- **Severity**: Medium
- **Location**: `backend/app/Http/Controllers/Api/KategoriUtamaController.php`, line 69
- **Line Content**: `public function show(KategoriUtama $kategoriUtama)`
- **Description**: The `show` method allows any authenticated user to view any `KategoriUtama` object by its ID. This bypasses the authorization logic present in the `index` method, which restricts access based on the user's department (`bidang`). An attacker could potentially enumerate IDs to view categories they are not supposed to have access to.
- **Recommendation**: Implement an authorization check (e.g., using a Form Request or a policy) in the `show` method to verify that the authenticated user is permitted to view the requested `KategoriUtama` object, consistent with the logic in the `index` method.

### Finding 2: Critical Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

- **Severity**: High
- **Location**: `backend/app/Http/Controllers/Api/KategoriUtamaController.php`, line 85
- **Line Content**: `public function destroy(KategoriUtama $kategoriUtama)`
- **Description**: The `destroy` method allows any authenticated user to delete any `KategoriUtama` object by its ID. It lacks any authorization check, meaning a malicious user from one department could delete the categories of another, leading to data loss and potential application disruption.
- **Recommendation**: Immediately implement an authorization check (e.g., using a Form Request or a policy) in the `destroy` method. The check should ensure that only users with the appropriate permissions (e.g., an administrator or a user within the same department who has delete rights) can perform this action.

### Finding 3: Broken Access Control

- **Severity**: High
- **Location**: `backend/app/Http/Requests/StoreProgramKerjaRequest.php`, line 12
- **Line Content**: `return true;`
- **Description**: The `authorize` method in `StoreProgramKerjaRequest` always returns `true`, allowing any authenticated user to create a new `ProgramKerja`. This could allow low-privilege users to create unauthorized work programs, disrupting organizational planning.
- **Recommendation**: Implement proper authorization logic. For example, check if the authenticated user has a specific role or permission, such as 'admin', before allowing the request to proceed. Example: `return $this->user()->hasRole('admin');`

### Finding 4: Broken Access Control

- **Severity**: Low
- **Location**: `backend/app/Http/Controllers/Api/ProgramKerjaController.php`, line 51
- **Line Content**: `public function show(ProgramKerja $programKerja)`
- **Description**: The `show` method lacks any explicit authorization check. While the `index` method currently exposes all `ProgramKerja` data, relying on this implicit permission is a poor security practice. If access rights for the `index` method change in the future, this endpoint would remain open, violating the principle of least privilege.
- **Recommendation**: Add an explicit authorization check to the `show` method. Even if it simply returns `true` for now, it establishes a clear and secure pattern for future development. A policy-based check like `$this->authorize('view', $programKerja);` is recommended.

### Finding 5: Broken Access Control

- **Severity**: High
- **Location**: `backend/app/Http/Requests/UpdateProgramKerjaRequest.php`, line 12
- **Line Content**: `return true;`
- **Description**: The `authorize` method in `UpdateProgramKerjaRequest` always returns `true`, allowing any authenticated user to update any `ProgramKerja`. A malicious user could change the active year or other critical details, leading to data integrity issues across the application.
- **Recommendation**: Implement proper authorization logic. For example, check if the authenticated user has a specific role or permission, such as 'admin', before allowing the request to proceed. Example: `return $this->user()->hasRole('admin');`

### Finding 6: Broken Access Control

- **Severity**: High
- **Location**: `backend/app/Http/Controllers/Api/ProgramKerjaController.php`, line 80
- **Line Content**: `public function destroy(ProgramKerja $programKerja)`
- **Description**: The `destroy` method lacks proper authorization. Any authenticated user can delete any inactive `ProgramKerja` by its ID. This could lead to the irreversible loss of historical data.
- **Recommendation**: Implement an authorization check to ensure that only users with administrative privileges can delete a `ProgramKerja`. Example: `$this->authorize('delete', $programKerja);`
